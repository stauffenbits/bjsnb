    "# ijsnb: A Jupyter-like Browser Javascript Notebook\n",

    "Jupyter Notebooks famously run in the browser. This is great: The sys-admin doesn't have to worry about what you're running, as long as it can run an HTML5-capable browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you write [Python 3](https://python.org), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), [Julia](https://julialang.org), or even [box-lang](https://github.com/box-lang), you might have wondered: \n",
    "\n",
    "> Why isn't there a kernel for writing vanilla Javascript?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to that is probably because it doesn't require a round trip to a server to run from a browser. You can just run it in the browser. And that's what this page does. It literally calls `eval(...)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Types\n",
    "In good repl fashion, the output of the last command is written to the output field below a code cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Type Output\n",
    "The basic types are stringified. Undefined is not printed. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Composite Output\n",
    "Arrays and Objects are treated special: Arrays get an indexed table, and objects get a key-value table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vega Lite Schema Output\n",
    "If a returned object is a vega-lite schema (ie, if it has a `$schema` property beginning with `https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/`), es.ipynb will attempt to render the result using vega-embed.\n"
